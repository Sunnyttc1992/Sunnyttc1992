# 👋 Hi, I'm Sunny Chuenchom
I'm a data scientist with a background in real-world experience leading digital transformation projects. Currently graduate a Master’s in Applied Data Science at the University of Michigan (Class of 2025).
I specialize in applying AI, machine learning, and generative AI to solve real-world problems—particularly in the healthcare, automotive, and robotics industries.
My projects span from medical chatbots using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I enjoy bridging the gap between technical systems and strategic outcomes, bringing a coach's mindset to every project—structured, goal-oriented, and relentlessly curious.


🎓 Master’s in Applied Data Science @ University of Michigan  
🤖 Passionate about AI, ML, Robotics, and Healthcare Innovation  
🌍 Bridging insights from Engineering to Data-Driven Strategy
