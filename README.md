  # 👋 Hi, I'm Sunny Chuenchom
  I'm a data scientist with a background in real-world experience leading digital transformation projects. Currently pursuing a Master’s in Applied Data Science at the University of Michigan (Class of 2025), I specialize in applying AI, machine learning, and generative AI to solve real-world problems—particularly in the healthcare, automotive, and robotics industries.

My projects span from medical chatbots using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to Parkinson's disease progression modeling and stock forecasting with LSTMs. I enjoy bridging the gap between technical systems and strategic outcomes, bringing a coach's mindset to every project—structured, goal-oriented, and relentlessly curious.
